# Tester Document Templates
## *Emma Urquhart's Lego Bricks for the DPU*
The project contains all Lego AGILE Components created for the ATOS Digital Prototyping Unit.
These bricks were created with the intention of steramlining Agile Testing within the DPU.

## TestPlanTemplate_Blank.docm 

The blank template file. This is an Agile Test Plan designed to fit the Agile core tenants of being quick to write, quick to read, and informative with no excess data. It's 5 simple, straightforward pages and is designed to be **written in fifteen minutes and read in five**.

## TestPlanTemplate_704Example.docm  

An example test plan showing how the file looks when filled out. Project 704 was used as an example.

## TestScriptTemplate.doc  [Not Yet Uploaded]

This template for test scripts/test cases is a bit of a conundrum, because there's a conflict at it's core: **test scripts aren't agile**. It's unnecessary documetnation that slows down the testing process, and in a fast-paced Agiel environment that's a risk.

But for projects that specifically request test scripts, as some of mine have, I'm working to find a happy medium. These include:

* Checklists (Trello Friendly!)
* Off-the-cuff documents written during exploratory testing
* Formal test scripts
* Screenshot lists using Windows Problem Steps Recorder -- Credit to Simon Birch
* Recorded sessions using Open Broadcasting Studio -- credit to Simon Birch

For this Lego brick, I'm focussing on the idea of formal test scripts that can be shared with clients and team members. 
I'm trying to find something that is relatively quick, reasonably professional, and above all else: SIMPLE. 

Current work-in-progress attempts are using Cambridge University Presss's Agile test script template, spreadsheets and checklists in combination with user stories.
